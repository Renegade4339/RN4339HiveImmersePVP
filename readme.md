# Immerse PvP
### Also known as Project Beesting

This pack was made since 2025 and is designed for Hive Bedrock's SkyWars, BedWars, Capture The Flag, and The Bridge gamemodes. There's also a compatibility with SkyWars in particular, for whether the ores are to be like actual lucky blocks.

## Caveat

This pack is designed for Hive's SkyWars, BedWars, Capture The Flag, and The Bridge gamemodes and as such will conflict anything else.

## Contribution

Anyone can contribute to this pack, but they must follow the guidelines put into place, as shown below:

## Contribution Guidelines

### For textures:
1. The theming must be medieval fantasy sci-fi.
2. It must be closely similar to Hive's and/or Minecraft's art style.
3. Main resolution is 16x, similar to Minecraft's.
4. It should NOT be AI-Generated.... obviously.
5. It must be of original works from the contributor.
6. It must not follow the stereotypical ones from most resource packs. (i.e all swords are short, ore borders)
7. The texture shouldn't conflict either of Minecraft's or Hive's artstyles.

### For sounds:
1. It must fit within the gamemodes of SkyWars, BedWars, Capture The Flag, and The Bridge.
2. It should be fitting within the theming and tone of the pack (up to my discretion whether it fits or not, really.)
3. The sounds must be compatible with one another. (i.e two sounds for when winning)
4. Credit must be enforced, even if it's a stock sound effect.

### For music:
1. It must be a (mostly) instrumental soundtrack.
2. It should be fitting for a situation of combat.
3. It must NOT be from a mainstream composer (i.e Lana Del Rey).
4. The soundtrack should not be copyrighted. Refer to YouTube.
5. If it's a remix, type the name initials of the original composer. (i.e fp_warfare)
